## Project Overview

This project is a final project given as an activity to implement the knowledge that has been given during the data science bootcamp batch 17 from [Rakamin Academy](https://rakamin.com/). 

This project is in the form of making a machine learning model to classify credit card customers will be default or not in the following month by using several machine learning algorithms and followed by tuning hyperparameters to get the optimal model. 

In addition to focusing on model performance, this project also focuses on completing case studies by providing several business recommendations based on the results of data exploration.

The project consist of 3 stages:
<ul>
 <li>Stage 1: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</li>
 <li>Stage 2: Data preprocessing (data cleaning, standardization, and feature engineering)</li>
 <li>Stage 3: Machine learning training and testing</li>
</ul>

## Problem Statement
   
Credit card is a flexible tool by which a customer can use a bank's money for a short period of time.

Predicting accurately which customers are most probable to default represents a significant business opportunity for all banks. Bank cards are the most common credit card type in Taiwan, which emphasizes the impact of risk prediction on both the consumers and banks.

This would inform the bankâ€™s decisions on criteria to approve a credit card application and also decide upon what credit limit to provide.

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Using the information given, predict the probability of a customer defaulting in the next month.

## Goal of the model
Reduce default rate
